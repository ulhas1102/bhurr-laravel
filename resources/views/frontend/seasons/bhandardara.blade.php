                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Arthur Lake :</strong>One of Bhandardara's
                        main attractions, Arthur Lake is an expansive

                        monsoon, the lake's beauty is enhanced by the
                        surrounding greenery and misty hills. Visitors can
                        enjoy boating or simply relax by the lakeside,
                        soaking in the serene atmosphere.

                        become a breathtaking spectacle as water cascades
                        down the rocks, surrounded by lush forests. The
                        sound of the roaring water and the mist in the air

                        captivating.</li>
                    <li><strong>Amruteshwar Temple :</strong>This ancient
