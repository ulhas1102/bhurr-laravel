                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Alibaug Beach :</strong>
                        Alibaug’s namesake beach is one of its most famous
                        spots. In the monsoon, the beach takes on a
                        different character with cloudy skies and the sound

                        due to strong tides, the beach is perfect for long
                        walks and soaking in the beauty of the Arabian Sea.
                    </li>

                            Fort (Alibag Fort) :</strong>Situated just off
                        the shore of
                        Alibaug Beach, Kolaba Fort is steeped in history,
                        having been a strategic naval base during the
                        Maratha empire. During the monsoon, visitors can

                        rides to the fort may be restricted during heavy
                        rains, the fort’s towering structure amidst the sea
                        waves is a sight to behold during the monsoon. The

                        During the monsoon, the rain adds to the beach’s
                        charm, and it’s a great place to enjoy the drizzle
